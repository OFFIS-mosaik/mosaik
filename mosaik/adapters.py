# This module provides a way of introducing new versions of the mosaik
# API without having to check the version of the API everywhere in the
# code. The basic idea is to work on the "request" level, i.e. when it
# has already been turned into a basic Python datatype (usually a tuple
# consisting of the name of the function, the arguments and the keyword
# arguments) but before the request has been encoded into JSON. This
# representation is then adapted by removing fields that are not
# understood by simulators for previous versions. On the way back,
# fields that are not supplied by old simulators can be filled with
# default values that achieve the old behaviour.
#
# A disadvantage of this method is that old simulators will incur an
# extra level of indirection with each new version of the API. However,
# simulators that are up-to-date will not have any additional
# indirection.
#
# When creating a new version of the low-level API, adapt the rest of
# the mosaik code to use it. Then add a V(new)toV(old)Adapter class in
# this file which turns adapts requests conforming to the new version
# into requests conforming to the old version. Also add a version
# check to ``init_and_get_adapter`` that wraps older simulators in
# this new adapter.
