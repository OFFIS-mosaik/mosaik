==================================
Welcome to mosaik's documentation!
==================================

Mosaik is a flexible Smart Grid co-simulation framework.

Mosaik allows you to reuse and combine existing simulation models and simulators to 
create large-scale Smart Grid scenarios â€“ and by large-scale we mean thousands of 
simulated entities distributed over multiple simulator processes. These scenarios can 
then serve as a test bed for various types of control strategies (e.g., multi-agent 
systems (MAS) or centralized control).

Here, we provide the documentation about mosaik.
