Quickstart
==========

Mosaik runs on Linux, OS X and Windows. It requires `Python 3.3
<http://python.org>`_ or newer. To install everything, you need the package
manager `Pip <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_ which is
bundled with Python 3.4 and above.

We also strongly recommend you to install everything into a `virtualenv
<http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_.

Installing mosaik is very easy:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install mosaik


There is also a demo scenario that you can try. You can get it from
`Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-demo>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-demo
   $ cd mosaik-demo/
   $ pip install -r requirements
   $ python demo.py

Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.
