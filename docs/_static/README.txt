Most images in this folder are available in three versions:

``*-inkscape.svg``
  These are the base SVG images for editing via Inkscape. All changes should be
  made here.

- ``*.svg``
  These files are normal SVG images and used in the documentation. Before
  exporting normal SVGs from Inkscape, convert all text objects to path via
  *Path / Object to Path*. If you forget this, web browsers may not render the
  images with the correct fonts and then they look ugly.

- ``*.png``
  These files are bitmap exports from Inkscape. Make sure that you export them
  with a high enough resolution so that they look nice on high-resolution
  displays (e.g., 1000px width if you plan to display them at a width of
  500px).

In images for the documentation on Read the Docs you should use the Fonts
*Lato* and *Roto Slab*, so that they fit nicely into the site design.

Other images (e.g., in presentations) should use mosaik's logo font *Aller*.
