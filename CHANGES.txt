Changelog
=========

2.0a3 – 2014-06-26
------------------

- [NEW] Hierarchical entities: Entities can now have a list of child entities
  (`issue #14`_).
- [NEW] The ``World`` class now has a ``get_data()`` method that allows you to
  get data from entities while creating a scenario.
- [NEW] ``World.connect(a, b, ('X', 'X'))`` can now be simplified to
  ``World.connect(a, b, 'X')``.
- [NEW] Attribute ``Entity.full_id`` which uniquely identifies an entity:
  ``'<sid>/<eid>'``
- [NEW] Attribute ``ModelFactory.meta`` which is the meta data dictionary of
  a simulator.
- [NEW] ``World()`` now accepts a configuration dictionary which can, e.g.,
  specify the network address for mosaik.
- [NEW] Overview section for the docs
- [NEW] Description of the mosaik API in the docs
- [CHANGE] When you create entities, mosaik checks if the model parameters
  actually exists and raises an error if not (`issue #9`_).
- [CHANGE] The mosaik API’s ``init()`` function now receives the simulator ID
  as first argument (`issue #15`_).
- [CHANGE] The behavior of the ``get_related_entities()`` RPC that simulators
  can perform has been changed.
- [CHANGE] Various internal improvements
- [FIX] `issue #18`_. Improved the error message if a Python simulator could
  not be imported.
- [REMOVED] Attribute ``Entity.rel``.

2.0a2 – 2014-05-05
------------------

- [NEW] Preliminary documentation and installation instructions
  (https://mosaik.readthedocs.org)

- [NEW] Simulators can now set data to other simulators using the
  asynchronous request *set_data* (`issue #1`_).

- [NEW] There is now a start timeout for external processes (`issue #11`_).

- [CHANGE] Mosaik now raises an error if a simulator uses the wrong API version
  (`issue #4`_).

- [CHANGE] Mosaik prints everything to *stdout* instead of using the Python
  logging module (`issue #7`_).

- [FIX] `issue #2`_. Scheduling now works properly for processes using async.
  requests. New keyword argument *async_requests* for ``World.connect()``.

- [FIX] `issue #3`_. Local (in-process) Simulators can now also perform async.
  requests to mosaik (*get_progress*, *get_related_entities*, *get_data*,
  *set_data*).

- [FIX] `issue #8`_. Cleaned up the code a bit.

- [FIX] `issue #10`_. Tests for the sim manager improved.

2.0a1 – 2014-03-26
------------------

- Mosaik 2 is a complete rewrite of mosaik 1 in order to improve its
  maintainability and flexibility. It is still an early alpha version and
  neither feature complete nor bug free.

- Removed features:

  - The *mosl* DSL (including Eclipse xtext and Java) are now gone. Mosaik now
    only uses Python.

  - Mosaik now longer has executables but is now used as a library.

  - The platform manager is gone.

  - Mosaik no longer includes a database.

  - Mosaik no longer includes a web UI.

- Mosaik now consists of four core components with the following feature sets:

  - mosaik API

    - The API has bean cleaned up and simplified.

    - Simulators and control strategies share the same API.

    - There are only four calls from mosaik to a simulator: *init*, *create*,
      *step* and *get_data*.

    - Simulators / processes can make asynchronous requests to mosaik during a
      step: *get_progress*, *get_related_entities*, *get_data*.

    - ZeroMQ with JSON is replaced by plain network sockets with JSON.

  - Scenarios:

    - Pure Python is now used to describe scenarios. This offers you more
      flexibility to create complex scenarios.

    - Scenario creation simplified: Start a simulator to get a model factory.
      Use the factory to create model instances (*entities*). Connect entities.
      Run simulation.

    - Connection rules are are no based on a primitive *connect* function that
      only connects two entities with each other. On top of that, any
      connection strategy can be implemented.

  - Simulation Manager:

    - Simulators written in Python 3 can be executed *in process*.

    - Simulators can be started as external processes.

    - Mosaik can connect to an already running instance of a simulator. This
      can be used as a replacement for the now gone platform manager.

  - Simulation execution:

    - The simulation is now event-based. No schedule and no synchronization
      points need to be computed.

    - Simulators can have different and varying step sizes.

- Mosaik ecosystem:

  - A high-level implementation of the mosaik 2 API currently only exists for
    Python. See https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-api-python.

  - *mosaik-web* is a simple visualization for mosaik simulations. See
    https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-web.

  - *mosaik-pypower* is an adapter for the *PYPOWER* load flow analysis
    library. See https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-pypower and
    https://github.com/rwl/PYPOWER.

  - *mosaik-csv* and *mosaik-householdsim* are simple demo simulators that you
    can use to "simulate" CSV data sets and load-profile based households. See
    https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-csv and
    https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-householdsim.

  - There is a repository containing a simple demo scenario for mosaik. See
    https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-demo.
