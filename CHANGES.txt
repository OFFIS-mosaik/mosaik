Changelog
=========

2.6.0 - 2020-05-08
------------------

- [NEW] The print of the simulation progress is now optional and can be disabled via a flag
  world.run(END, print_progress=False).
- [NEW] Additional starters can now be added via external packages (the standard ones are
  'python', 'cmd', and 'connect').

2.5.3 - 2020-04-30
------------------

- [FIX] Constrain simpy version to <4.0.0 due to simpy.io incompatibility
- [CHANGE] Updated Odysseus tutorial
- [CHANGE] Eliminated shifted_cache which reduces memory consumption

2.5.2 - 2019-11-01
------------------

- [NEW] Special characters are now allowed in path names
- [NEW] Compatible to the new versions of networkx
- [CHANGE] python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 are currently supported, python 3.4 and 3.5 not anymore.
- [FIX] Various minor internal changes
- [FIX] Various documentation updates and fixes

2.5.1 - 2018-11-29
------------------

- [NEW] When calling the world.start() command for a simulator, users can now set a predefined
  value for the posix flag (e.g. True) to prevent automatic detection of the operating system.
  This facilitates the creation of some co-simulation cases across OS (e.g. Windows and Linux).

2.5.0 - 2018-09-05
------------------

- [NEW] Connection option "time_shifted" added as alternative to async_requests. This will
  make creating cyclic data dependencies between simulators more usable since usage of
  set_data with an API implementation will no longer be needed.

2.4.0 - 2017-12-06
------------------

- [NEW] Compatible to the new versions of networkx, simpy and simpy.io
- [CHANGE] python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 are currently supported python 3.3 is no longer supported
- [FIX] Various bug fixes

2.3.0 - 2016-04-26
------------------

- [NEW] Allow passing environment vars to sup processes
- [FIX] Fixed a bug in the version validation which raised an error when using
  a floating point for the version

2.2.0 - 2016-02-15
------------------

- [NEW] API version 2.2: Added an optional "setup_done()" method.

- [CHANGE] API version validation: The API version is no longer an integer but
  a "major.minor" string.  The *major* part has to match with mosaik's major
  version. The *minor* part may be lower or equal to mosaik's minor version.

- [FIX] Various minor fixes and stability improvements.

- [FIX] Various documentation updates and fixes.

2.1.2 – 2014-10-29
------------------

- [FIX] ``World.shutdown()`` now checks if the socket still exists before
  attempting to close it.

- [FIX] Fixed a bug that made the last extra method of a simulator shadow all
  previous ones.

2.1.1 – 2014-10-28
------------------

- [NEW] ``World.run()`` now prints a warning if you forget to connect
  a simulator's entities.
- [FIX] Fixed some problems with the data-flow cache.

2.1 – 2014-10-24
----------------

- [NEW] Mosaik can now perform real-time simulations. Before, this
  functionality needed to be implemented by simulators. Now it’s just
  ``World.run(until=x, rt_factor=y)``, where ``rt_factor`` defines the
  simulation speed relative to the wall-clock time (`issue #24`).

- [NEW] Simulators can now expose extra methods via their API that can be
  called from a mosaik scenario. This allows you to, e.g., store static data in
  a data base. These extra API methods need to be specified in the simulator’s
  meta data (`issue #26`_).

- [NEW] ``util.connect_many_to_one()`` helper function.

- [NEW] More and better documentation:

  - Tutorial for integrating simulators, control strategies and for creating
    scenarios.

  - Sim API description

  - Scenario API description

  - Sim Manager documentation

  - Scheduler documentation

  - Discussion of design decisions

  - Logo, colors, CI

- [NEW] Added ``util.sync_call()`` which eases calling proxied methods of
  a simulator synchronously.

- [CHANGE] The *rel* attribute in the entity description returned by *create()*
  is now optional.

- [CHANGE] Moved proxied methods from ``SimProxy`` to ``SimProxy.proxy`` in
  order to avoid potential name clashes with other attributes.

- [CHANGE] Check a simulator’s models and extra API methods for potential name
  clashes with the built-in API methods.

- [CHANGE] The argument *execution_graph* of ``World`` was renamed to *debug*.
  The execution graph now also stores the time after a simulation step (in
  addition to the time before the step).

- [FIX] `issue #22`_: The asynchronous requests *get_data()* and *set_data()*
  now check if the ``async_requests`` flag was set in ``World.connect()``.

- [FIX] `issue #23`_: *finalize()* is now called for in-process Python
  simulators.

- [FIX] `issue #27`_: Dramatically improved simulation performance (30 times as
  fast in some cases) if simulators use different step sizes (e.g. 1 minute and
  1 hour) by improving some internal data structures.

2.0 – 2014-09-22
----------------

- Mosaik 2 is a complete rewrite of mosaik 1 in order to improve its
  maintainability and flexibility.

- Removed features:

  - The *mosl* DSL (including Eclipse xtext and Java) are now gone. Mosaik now
    only uses Python.

  - Mosaik now longer has executables but is now used as a library.

  - The platform manager is gone.

  - The database is now a separate package, see `mosaik-hdf5`__.

  - The old web UI is gone.

- Mosaik now consists of four core components with the following feature sets:

  - mosaik Sim API

    - The API has bean cleaned up and simplified.

    - Simulators and control strategies share the same API.

    - There are only four calls from mosaik to a simulator: *init*, *create*,
      *step* and *get_data*.

    - Simulators / processes can make asynchronous requests to mosaik during a
      step: *get_progress*, *get_related_entities*, *get_data*, *set_data*.

    - ZeroMQ with JSON is replaced by plain network sockets with JSON.

  - Scenarios:

    - Pure Python is now used to describe scenarios. This offers you more
      flexibility to create complex scenarios.

    - Scenario creation simplified: Start a simulator to get a model factory.
      Use the factory to create model instances (*entities*). Connect entities.
      Run simulation.

    - Connection rules are are no based on a primitive *connect* function that
      only connects two entities with each other. On top of that, any
      connection strategy can be implemented.

  - Simulation Manager:

    - Simulators written in Python 3 can be executed *in process*.

    - Simulators can be started as external processes.

    - Mosaik can connect to an already running instance of a simulator. This
      can be used as a replacement for the now gone platform manager.

  - Simulation execution:

    - The simulation is now event-based. No schedule and no synchronization
      points need to be computed.

    - Simulators can have different and varying step sizes.

- Mosaik ecosystem:

  - A high-level implementation of the mosaik 2 API currently exists for
    Python__ and Java__.

  - *mosaik-web* is a simple visualization for mosaik simulations. See
    https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-web.

  - *mosaik-pypower* is an adapter for the *PYPOWER* load flow analysis
    library. See https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-pypower and
    https://github.com/rwl/PYPOWER.

  - *mosaik-csv* and *mosaik-householdsim* are simple demo simulators that you
    can use to "simulate" CSV data sets and load-profile based households. See
    https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-csv and
    https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-householdsim.

  - There is a repository containing a simple demo scenario for mosaik. See
    https://bitbucket.org/mosaik/mosaik-demo.
